Crate Frenzy
A submission to Trijam 115: The 3 hour game jam, made in 3 hours.

In Crate Frenzy you play as V-98, a robot who has to navigate the galactic warehouse to get his delivery out. But he can't find his way by himself: help him get there by using crates to get to each door!
Controls

    WASD or Arrow Keys to move V-98
    Click on a crate to pick it up, release to drop it

Gameplay

You must click and drag crates into the right position so V-98 can get to each door. Some puzzles require you to hold the crates in mid air or move them around after the first jump.
